    <h1>Perfect Cast-Iron Skillet Chicken Thighs</h1>

    <img src="../img/chicken-thighs.jpg" alt="An image of roasted chicken thighs">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Sophisticated enough for a Sunday supper yet quick enough for Wednesday's dinner,
        this master recipe is all in the technique.
        Cook the thighs skin side down in a cast-iron skillet to render out the fat and make the skin as crisp and,
        dare we say, delicious as bacon.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <strong>2 to 4 main-course</strong>
    
    <ul>
        <li>6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/4 pounds)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 475Â°. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
            Heat oil in a 12" cast-iron or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking.
            Nestle chicken in skillet, skin side down, and cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high; 
            continue cooking skin side down, occasionally rearranging chicken thighs and rotating pan to evenly distribute heat, 
            until fat renders and skin is golden brown, about 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer skillet to oven and cook 13 more minutes. 
            Flip chicken; continue cooking until skin crisps and meat is cooked through, 
            about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate; let rest 5 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
